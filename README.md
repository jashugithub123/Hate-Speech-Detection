# Hate-Speech-Detection

Developed a machine learning model to automatically detect and classify hate speech in social media text. The project involved data preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization), feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings, and training classification models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and LSTM. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The final model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content.
